 COMMAND
      techmap
 DESCRIPTION
      Maps design into specified technology.
      Libraries from ldb are used for mapping.
      'techmap' should not be run for elaborated design without at least single 'opt' run.
         At this stage design has structures not ready to mapping, like missed design connections (undriven D pins of FF...).
